## Security Best Practices

When using GoCacheX in production:

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update to the latest stable version
2. **Network Security**: Use TLS/SSL for Redis and Memcached connections
3. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
4. **Monitoring**: Enable logging and monitoring for suspicious activities
5. **Configuration**: Follow security configuration guidelines in our documentation
6. **Data Sensitivity**: Be mindful of sensitive data in cache keys and values

## Known Security Considerations

- **Data Exposure**: Cache data is stored unencrypted by default
- **Network Traffic**: Ensure secure connections for distributed backends
- **Memory Management**: Be aware of potential memory exhaustion attacks
- **Configuration**: Secure configuration files and environment variables
